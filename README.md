## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application is hosted on Google Cloud, using Docker for containerization and NGINX as a reverse proxy to efficiently manage requests to the Node.js application. It leverages MongoDB for database operations and Redis for caching, providing a robust backend for blockchain-based gaming applications.

**Core Technologies:**
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions and caching
- **Blockchain**: Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live updates
- **Queue**: Bull for background job processing

*Directory Structure*

- /config: Configuration files for the application.
- /controllers: Controllers to handle business logic.
- /middleware: Middleware functions for request processing.
- /models: Mongoose schemas/models for database operations.
- /nginx: NGINX configuration files.
- /node_modules: Node.js libraries (not committed to Git).
- /routes: Routes to handle API requests via Express.
- /services: Services for business logic.
- /uploads: Temp/Storage for uploaded files.
- /utils: Utility scripts and helper functions.

*Prerequisites*
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Access to Google Cloud for deployment

*Local Development*
To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.localhost.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.localhost.yml up -d
```


## üîß Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build TypeScript files
npm run build:watch  # Build TypeScript files in watch mode
npm run test         # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
npm run lint         # Check code style with ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Fix code style issues automatically
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run migrate      # Run database migrations
npm run migrate-down # Rollback database migrations
npm run health-check # Check service health status
npm run validate-config # Validate environment configuration
```

## üè• Health Monitoring

The service provides comprehensive health check endpoints for monitoring and load balancer integration:

- `GET /health` - Basic health status (lightweight for load balancers)
- `GET /health/detailed` - Detailed system status with dependency checks
- `GET /ready` - Readiness check for Kubernetes and container orchestration
- `GET /live` - Liveness check for Kubernetes pod management
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics and system information

Example health check response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Service is healthy",
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "uptime": 3600,
    "checks": {
      "mongodb": { "status": "healthy", "responseTime": 5 },
      "redis": { "status": "healthy", "responseTime": 2 }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîê Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Redis Sessions**: Distributed session storage with automatic expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request rate limiting per endpoint
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation and sanitization
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure environment-based configuration management
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing policies
- **Helmet Security**: Security headers and protection middleware

## üåç Multi-Environment Support

The application supports multiple deployment environments with specific configurations:

```bash
# Development Environment
npm run dev
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up

# Staging Environment  
npm run docker:staging
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up

# Production Environment
npm run docker:prod
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up
```

Each environment has its own configuration file (`.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`) with appropriate settings for database connections, external services, and security parameters.
