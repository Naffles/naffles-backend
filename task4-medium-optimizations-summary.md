  - **Request Tracking**: HTTP request duration, status codes, and error rates
  - **Database Monitoring**: Query performance and database statistics
  - **Redis Monitoring**: Operation performance and memory usage
  - **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, and system resource monitoring
  - **Performance Alerts**: Automated alerting for performance issues
  - **Metrics Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old metrics to prevent memory leaks

#### Performance Middleware (`middleware/performanceMiddleware.js`)
- **Purpose**: Integrates performance monitoring into the application
- **Features**:
  - Request performance tracking middleware
  - Database query performance monitoring
  - Redis operation performance wrapper
  - Error tracking and logging
  - Health check endpoint (`/health`)
  - Metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) for admin access

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite

#### Comprehensive Raffle Tests (`tests/raffle.comprehensive.test.js`)
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing of raffle functionality
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Raffle creation (NFT, token, unlimited types)
  - Raffle queries and filtering
  - Ticket purchasing and validation
  - Raffle drawing and winner selection
  - Raffle cancellation and refunds
  - Performance testing with large datasets
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Concurrent operations testing

#### Analytics Tests (`tests/analytics.test.js`)
- **Purpose**: Testing of analytics functionality
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Raffle analytics generation
  - Platform statistics calculation
  - User participation analytics
  - Leaderboard generation
  - Data filtering and date ranges
  - Error handling for invalid inputs

#### Socket.IO Tests (`tests/socket.test.js`)
- **Purpose**: Testing of real-time functionality
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Connection and authentication
  - Room joining and leaving
  - Event emission and reception
  - Personal and global notifications
  - Connection statistics
  - Error handling for invalid tokens
  - Unauthenticated connection handling

## Integration Points

### 1. Existing Raffle Service Integration
The new components integrate seamlessly with the existing raffle system:
- Socket events are triggered during ticket purchases, winner selections, and cancellations
- Analytics data is collected from existing raffle, ticket, and winner models
- Performance monitoring tracks existing API endpoints and database operations

### 2. Authentication Integration
- Socket.IO uses existing JWT authentication system
- Analytics endpoints respect existing role-based access control
- Performance metrics are protected by admin-only access controls

### 3. Database Integration
- Analytics queries use existing MongoDB collections
- Performance monitoring tracks existing database operations
- No new database schemas required - leverages existing models

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Real-Time Updates
- Eliminates need for frequent polling of raffle status
- Provides instant feedback for user actions
- Reduces server load through efficient WebSocket connections

### 2. Analytics Optimization
- Aggregation pipelines for efficient data processing
- Indexed queries for fast analytics generation
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed metrics

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- Proactive identification of performance bottlenecks
- Automated alerting for system issues
- Resource usage optimization through monitoring insights

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for Socket.IO connections
- Role-based access control for sensitive analytics endpoints
- User isolation for personal analytics data

### 2. Data Privacy
- Users can only access their own analytics data
- Admin-only access for platform-wide statistics
- No sensitive user information exposed in public endpoints

### 3. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention
- Performance monitoring helps identify abuse patterns
- Connection limits and room management prevent resource exhaustion
- Error tracking helps identify potential security issues

## Usage Examples

### 1. Real-Time Raffle Updates
```javascript
// Client-side Socket.IO integration
socket.emit('joinRaffle', raffleId);
socket.on('ticketPurchased', (data) => {
  updateRaffleDisplay(data);
});
socket.on('winnerAnnounced', (data) => {
  showWinnerCelebration(data);
});
```

### 2. Analytics API Usage
```javascript
// Get raffle analytics
const response = await fetch(`/api/analytics/raffles/${raffleId}`);
const analytics = await response.json();

// Get user leaderboard
const leaderboard = await fetch('/api/analytics/leaderboard?sortBy=tickets&limit=10');
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Health check
const health = await fetch('/health');
const status = await health.json();

// Admin metrics (requires authentication)
const metrics = await fetch('/api/metrics', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${adminToken}` }
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Analytics
- Machine learning-based user behavior analysis
- Predictive analytics for raffle success rates
- Advanced visualization and reporting tools

### 2. Enhanced Real-Time Features
- Voice chat integration for gaming
- Live streaming of raffle drawings
- Real-time collaborative features

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Redis caching for analytics data
